# Duplicates_finder
The micro-project checks a folder and its contents for duplicate files. 
To use it, simply run `python main.py` and enter the path to the folder you want to check for duplicates. 
The program will then display a list of duplicated files. It is up to you to decide which files to keep and which to remove.
